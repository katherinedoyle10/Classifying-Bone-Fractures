# Project Description 
The goal of our project is to test and train a neural network  to classify if an X-ray scan shows a bone fracture, and if so, what type. Once the neural network is trained and functional, it could have real-time applications in hospital and other clinical settings. This project could create great strides in accelerating the diagnostic process for bone fractures and minimize patient wait time. The neural network will receive an X-ray scan image and classify it as elbow negative, finger negative, forearm negative, hand negative, shoulder negative, elbow positive, finger positive, forearm positive, hand positive, shoulder positive. In this dataset, negative images are of bones are that are not fractured, while positive images are. The dataset used for this project was found on Kaggle named 'XR-bones Dataset for Bone Fracture Detection'. Both the negative and positive images for the five body parts will be used to train and test the neural network. This neural network has the potential to be a great addition to the diagnostic tools avaiable to physicians around the world, as it can speed up the process of being diagnosed with a bone fracture.
